# Golang
During the learning process of GO, I have developed a sample code for Conference Ticket Booking. 
This code encompasses all the concepts that I have learned.

The story goes that Google engineers designed Go while waiting for other programs to compile. Their frustration at their toolset forced them to rethink system programming from 
the ground up, creating a lean, mean, and compiled solution that allows for massive multithreading, concurrency, and performance under pressure. 

Running Go on modern hardware—and even inside containers or on virtual machines—can be a real pleasure. Because Go was designed to run on multiple cores, it is built to support 
concurrency and scale as cores are added. Further, its multithreading capabilities—most specifically, its goroutines—are a surprising and welcome addition to your bag of tricks.
